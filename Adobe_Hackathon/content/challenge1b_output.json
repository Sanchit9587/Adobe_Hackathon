We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.**\n\n**Key Architectural Components:**\n\n*   **Transformer Model:** The document describes a Transformer model.\n*   **Encoder Self-Attention:** The key observation is that multiple attention heads within the encoder self-attention layer (at layer 5 of 6) exhibit behavior related to sentence structure.\n*   **Two Examples:** Two specific examples illustrate this behavior \u2013 two different heads performing distinct tasks.\n\n**Training Methodology (Relevant to the Observed Behavior):**\n\n*   **Attention Heads:** The model uses attention heads, implying a mechanism for focusing on different aspects of the input sequence.\n*   **Different Tasks:** The heads \u201clearned to perform different tasks\u201d \u2013 this suggests the model is adapting to the input."
